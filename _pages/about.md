**Hello!**

I am Erfan Nejati, a second-year Ph.D. student in <a href="https://www.rotman.utoronto.ca/faculty-and-research/academic-areas/operations-management-and-statistics/" target="_blank">Operations Management and Statistics</a> at Rotman School of Management, University of Toronto.

Before joining Rotman, I received my M.Sc. degree in Industrial Engineering from the University of Tehran and my B.Sc. in the same field from Iran University of Science and Technology.
